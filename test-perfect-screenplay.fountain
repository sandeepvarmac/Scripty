FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A busy morning scene. SARAH (30s) walks up to the entrance.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sarah enters and approaches the counter where MIKE (40s) is working.

                    SARAH
          Morning! Could I get a large coffee?

                    MIKE
                    (smiling)
          Coming right up. Beautiful day, isn't it?

                    SARAH
          Perfect for writing. I'm working on a
          screenplay about coffee shop encounters.

Mike hands her the coffee.

                    MIKE
          How meta. What's it about?

                    SARAH
          Two strangers who meet in a coffee shop
          and discover they both love storytelling.

EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

Sarah sits with her laptop, typing furiously with inspiration.

                    SARAH
                    (to herself)
          Sometimes the best stories write themselves.

FADE OUT.
