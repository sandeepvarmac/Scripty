# ScriptyBoy Analysis Core DDL, Prisma & Sample Data â€” Summary

- Supplies Prisma schema mapped to the production SQL enums/tables, extending existing Script, Scene, Character, Evidence models with new fields and relations while adding Element, Beat, Note, Score, FeasibilityMetric, CharacterScene, Subplot, SubplotSpan, ThemeStatement, SceneThemeAlignment, RiskFlag, PageMetric models with Cascade referential actions.
- Provides a Prisma migration (migration.sql) implementing the same DDL changes: enums, table creations, column extensions, indexes, and unique constraints.
- Includes a comprehensive `prisma/seed.ts` that creates a sample project/script with scenes, characters, normalized analysis data (beats, notes, scores, feasibility metrics, subplots, risk flags, etc.) to drive dashboards.
- Offers a sample `dashboard_payload.json` reflecting the normalized structure expected by the UI: beats array, notes with apply hooks, risk flags, theme statements/alignment, feasibility metrics, page metrics, character presence, subplot spans, and rubric scores.
- Recommends npm scripts for migrations and seeding (prisma generate/migrate, prisma:seed) and outlines how to wire the payload into the front-end during development.
