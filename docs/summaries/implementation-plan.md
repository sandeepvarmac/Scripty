# Implementation Plan for Next Level Enhancements â€” Summary

- Provides a 14-week phased roadmap covering schema evolution, parsing upgrades, pipeline intelligence, dashboards, exports, integrations, and performance.
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): introduce new core tables (elements, beats, notes, feasibility_metrics, character_scenes, page_metrics) with provided SQL; extend existing tables and indexes.
- Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): enhance parsers for TXT, PDF password/OCR, typed element extraction, slug parsing; build normalization jobs and scene analytics.
- Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): implement detectors (beats, structure, dialogue, theme, feasibility, risk), rubric scoring, sensitivity toggles, telemetry, and project settings; add API contracts and services.
- Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8): deliver the multi-tab dashboards with Recharts visualizations, presence grids, heatmaps, waveform, and accessibility polish.
- Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10): create coverage/notes PDFs, CSV/JSON exports, FDX change list, export UI, and email/webhook flows.
- Phase 6 (Weeks 11-12): harden security, quotas, observability, admin dashboards, user settings, and third-party integration hooks.
- Phase 7 (Weeks 13-14): optimize DB (indexes, caching, materialized views), pipeline parallelism, model prompt efficiency, and overall scalability.
- Lists milestone checkpoints (Weeks 2,4,7,9,12) and resource needs: Backend, Frontend, ML, QA, plus infra (DB scaling, GPU, storage, CDN).
