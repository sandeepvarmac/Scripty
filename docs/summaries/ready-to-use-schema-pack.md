# Ready to Use Schema Pack â€” Summary

- Supplies JSON Schemas for all structured outputs: beats, notes, risk flags, theme statements, scene theme alignment, feasibility metrics, page metrics, character scenes, subplot spans, score rows, coverage reports, exports, and consolidated dashboard payloads.
- Emphasizes `additionalProperties:false`, enumerated values matching DB enums, anchors (scene/page/line), confidence fields, and nested apply_hook metadata for notes.
- Includes a TypeScript LLM router implementation showing how to call OpenAI Responses API with structured outputs, cascading between gpt-5-mini/base/thinking based on confidence thresholds and policy flags.
- Router utilities: `routeBeats`, `routeNotes`, `routeRiskFlags`, `routeCoverageProse`, plus supporting helpers for structured calls, prompt caching, and escalation thresholds.
- Demonstrates integrating the schemas into the router (`schemas.ts`) and orchestrating pipeline steps: beat detection, note generation, risk review, and coverage prose creation from normalized analytics.
- Notes operational best practices: strict JSON enforcement, batching heavy workloads, caching prompts, gating sensitivity, and logging model usage for observability.
