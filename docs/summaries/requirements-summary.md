- Add 8 new database tables: elements, beats, notes, scores, feasibility_metrics, character_scenes, subplots, theme_statements, scene_theme_alignment, risk_flags, page_metrics
- Extend existing tables with new columns
- Enhanced UI with specialized tabs and visualizations
- Professional deliverables (Coverage PDF, Notes PDF/CSV, FDX change lists)
- Security and compliance features (sensitivity analysis, legal disclaimers)

### 2. Implementation Plan for Next Level Enhancements.md
**Purpose**: Detailed work breakdown and implementation roadmap
**Key Points**:
- 7-phase implementation over 14 weeks
- Database schema evolution â†’ Enhanced parsing â†’ Advanced UI â†’ Professional deliverables â†’ Security â†’ API integration â†’ Performance optimization
- Resource requirements and timeline specifications
- Milestone-based delivery approach

### 3. GPT Model Selection Playbook.md
**Purpose**: LLM routing strategy and model selection guidelines
**Key Points**:
- **Tier A**: gpt-5-mini for high-volume scene taggers, feasibility flags
- **Tier B**: gpt-5 for beats, subplots, theme analysis, coverage prose
- **Tier C**: gpt-5-thinking for ambiguous structure/legal-adjacent review
- Structured Outputs with JSON schemas for all LLM calls
- Escalation logic based on confidence and complexity

### 4. Ready to use Scheme pack.md
