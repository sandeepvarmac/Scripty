Short answer: yes—the “1 page ≈ 1 minute” rule is the industry shorthand (in 12-pt Courier, standard margins). So a properly formatted **90-page** feature is **about 90 minutes**.

But that’s only a baseline. Real runtime swings ±10–20% (or more) based on a few factors:

# What can change the minute-per-page math

* **Action vs. talkiness:**

  * Action, chases, fights, visual gags → often **slower than 1 min/page** (1.2–2.0 min).
  * Rapid, quippy dialogue → often **faster** (0.7–0.9 min/page).
* **Silent beats & atmospherics:** Pages with little dialogue but lots of tension/visual business usually **play longer** than they read.
* **Montages / inserts:** A half-page montage can easily run **1–3 minutes** on screen.
* **Dual dialogue / intercutting:** Two columns don’t double time—they often **shorten** time compared to reading them linearly.
* **Formatting fidelity:** The rule assumes **12-pt Courier**, \~1.5" left / \~1" right, 1" top/bottom, normal line spacing. Deviations (different fonts, tight/loose margins, extra whitespace) skew estimates.
* **Director’s pacing & coverage:** Shot length, pauses, and cutting style can stretch or compress the same page count.
* **Titles & credits (add-on):**

  * Opening titles: 0–90 seconds (sometimes none).
  * End credits: **2–7 minutes** is common; indie films may be \~2–3, big shows longer.

# Practical estimating

* **Baseline:** 90 pages → **\~90 min** (picture only).
* **Add credits:** +**\~3–5 min** typical → **\~93–95 min** total.
* **Adjust for style:**

  * Action-heavy? Add **+10–20%** → 99–108 min (plus credits).
  * Dialogue-heavy & fast? Subtract **\~10%** → \~81 min (plus credits).

# Quick “sanity check” method

Time a small sample:

1. Pick 5–10 representative pages (some action, some dialogue, a montage if you have one).
2. **Read dialogue aloud** and imagine realistic pauses; for action, estimate shot rhythm.
3. Compute average **seconds/page** from the sample and multiply by total pages.
4. Add **credits** separately.
