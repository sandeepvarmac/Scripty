Here’s a compact “field guide” to standard Hollywood screenplay formatting—what each element is, when to use it, and a quick example for each. (Assume 12-pt Courier, \~1 page ≈ 1 minute.)

# Core Page Setup

* **Font & spacing:** 12-pt Courier (or Courier Final Draft), single-spaced, 1.5” left margin, \~1” right, 1” top/bottom.
* **Length:** Most features 90–120 pages.

# 1) Title Page

Contains title, “by” line, contact info. No page number.

```

# 2) Scene Heading (Slugline)

Tells **where** and **when**. Form: `INT./EXT. LOCATION – DAY/NIGHT`. Use **CONTINUOUS** or **MOMENTS LATER** when relevant; add specifics (e.g., “INT. BMW – MOVING – NIGHT”).

```
EXT. KERALA BACKWATER – DAWN
```

# 3) Action / Description

Present-tense, visual only (what we can see/hear). Keep paragraphs tight (1–4 lines).

```
Mist rises off the water. A lone canoe glides past, silent as a shadow.
```

# 4) Character Cue

A character’s name centered, ALL CAPS, above their dialogue. Use the form they’re known by on first entry in action (also ALL CAPS there).

```
RAVI
```

# 5) Dialogue

Centered under the character cue; what they say.

```
RAVI
I didn’t come here for a fight.
```

# 6) Parenthetical (a.k.a. “wryly”)

A brief **how** or **to whom** note—use sparingly (direction belongs in action).

```
MEERA
(softly)
Then say what you came to say.
```

# 7) Extensions (V.O., O.S./O.C., CONT’D)

* **V.O.** (voice over): narrator, thoughts, letters.
* **O.S.** or **O.C.** (off screen/off camera): nearby but unseen.
* **(CONT’D)**: same character continues after an action beat (your software often adds this automatically).

```
RAVI (V.O.)
When the water is still, you hear everything.
```

# 8) Transitions

Right-aligned. Use sparingly—editing is mostly implied. Common: **CUT TO:**, **DISSOLVE TO:**, **SMASH CUT TO:**, **FADE OUT.**

```
                                                     SMASH CUT TO:
```

# 9) Shots & Camera Directions (Optional/Selective)

Use only when shot choice is story-critical: **CLOSE ON**, **POV**, **INSERT**, etc.

```
CLOSE ON – THE PHONE
A single text: “HE’S HERE.”
```

# 10) Introductions & CAPS

On first appearance in action: character name in ALL CAPS with a brief, telling detail.

```
RAVI (38), road-worn eyes, steps off the bus, scanning.
```

# 11) Sounds (SFX) & On-Screen Text (SUPER/CHYRON)

* **SFX:** Keep in action; caps the distinctive sound.
* **SUPER/CHYRON:** Words appearing on screen.

```
A DOOR SLAMS. Birds burst from the trees.

SUPER: “KOCHI, INDIA – 5:12 A.M.”
```

# 12) Phone Calls / Intercuts

Format as one side + parentheticals, or use **INTERCUT** to bounce between locations cleanly.

```
INTERCUT – RAVI’S BEDROOM / MEERA’S KITCHEN

RAVI
You’re not safe there.

MEERA
(whispers)
I know. He’s outside.
```

# 13) Dual Dialogue

Two characters speak at the same time. On the page, their dialogue is side-by-side (most software handles this). In plain text:

```
            RAVI                          MEERA
Don’t open the door.          I have to see who it is.
Right now, Meera!             I can’t just hide, Ravi!
```

# 14) Montages & Series of Shots

Use when time compresses or related beats need rhythm.

**MONTAGE – RAVI PREPARES:**

* He tapes a map to the wall.
* Loads a battered pistol.
* Circles a date on the calendar.

**END MONTAGE**

—or—

**SERIES OF SHOTS – THE DELIVERY ROUTE:**
A) A scooter weaves through traffic.
B) A gate creaks open.
C) A package slides under a door.

# 15) Time Lapses & Inserts

**LATER**, **MOMENTS LATER**, **THE NEXT DAY** as mini-slugs inside a scene, or in the main slugline.

```
LATER

The room is darker now; the phone still hasn’t rung.
```

# 16) Mini-Slugs (Secondary Slugs)

Quick location pivots within the same main location.

```
KITCHEN
Meera yanks open drawers.

BEDROOM
Ravi checks under the bed—nothing.
```

# 17) Foreign Language & Subtitles

Keep dialogue readable; indicate language and/or subtitles.

```
GUARD (in Malayalam; subtitled)
താങ്കൾക്ക് ഇവിടെ വരാൻ പാടില്ല.  
(You’re not allowed in here.)
```

# 18) Numbers, Dates, Music, Lyrics

* Spell out under ten; use numerals for time/date specifics.
* For specific **song cues**, clear rights later; on page, keep minimal:

```
MUSIC UP: A distant temple chant bleeds into sirens.
```

# 19) “CONTINUOUS,” “SAME,” “ESTABLISHING”

* **CONTINUOUS**: follows action immediately (often through a doorway).
* **SAME**: same time as previous scene.
* **ESTABLISHING**: opening shot of a place (use sparingly; the action can do this).

```
INT. STAIRWELL – CONTINUOUS
```

# 20) Endings

**FADE OUT.** and an optional **THE END** centered on the last page.

```
FADE OUT.

                                  THE END
```

---

# Tiny Sample Scene (Putting It Together)

```
FADE IN:

EXT. KERALA BACKWATER – DAWN

Mist clings to the canal. A canoe noses ashore.

INT. FISHERMAN’S SHACK – DAWN

RAVI (38), road-worn but alert, slips inside. He freezes.

CLOSE ON – A PHONE
SUPER: “MISSED CALLS (12) – MEERA”

A BOARD CREAKS O.S.

MEERA (O.S.)
(whispering)
Don’t move.

RAVI
(quiet, steady)
It’s me.

MEERA steps from shadow, a kitchen knife low at her side.

MEERA
Then why didn’t you answer?

The phone VIBRATES—again.

RAVI (V.O.)
When the water is still, you hear everything.

                                                     CUT TO:
```

## Quick Usage Tips

* Keep action lean and visual; avoid directing every shot.
* Use parentheticals and transitions sparingly.
* Let formatting serve clarity and pace, not style flourishes.
* Consistency beats perfection—pick a convention and stick to it.
