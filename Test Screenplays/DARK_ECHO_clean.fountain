EXT. BACK ALLEY BEHIND APARTMENT – NIGHT

A narrow alley. Humming streetlights. A lone MOPED ticks as it cools.
NISHA (hoodie up) drags a cracked CARDBOARD BOX from a dumpster.

She freezes. A metallic RASP echoes -- a vent fan? Or a whisper?

                      NISHA
            (to herself, barely audible)
            Don’t look back.

She folds the box, stuffs inside: a small DIGITAL RECORDER with red tape
across it: “D-ROOM.” Footsteps scrape nearby. Nisha bolts.

A SHADOW crosses the brick wall — the silhouette looks like DEV.

                                                         CUT TO:


INT. APARTMENT 3B – NIGHT

Dark. The only light: a FISH TANK glow.

NISHA locks the door. DEV sits at the table, fiddling with a ring of KEYS.

                      DEV
            Where were you? It’s past midnight.

                      NISHA
            I heard it again. In the vents. The voice that knows my name.

                      DEV
            We talked about this. The doctor said—

The bathroom fan kicks on by itself. Both turn. Silence.

                      DEV (CONT’D)
            I changed the locks. If someone has a spare key — that ends tonight.

He lifts a small metal KEY labeled “D.” Nisha’s eyes fix on it.

                      NISHA
            That’s not ours.

The fan stops. A muffled KNOCK from the ceiling. Three beats. Tap. Tap. Tap.

                      NISHA (CONT’D)
            That pattern. Same as the recording.

DEV pockets the “D” key, uneasy.


INT. STAIRWELL – NIGHT

Bare concrete. Emergency light flickers. NISHA hurries down. KIRAN, hoodie and
backpack, appears holding a TOOL ROLL and a tiny ENDOSCOPE camera.

                      KIRAN
            You texted? I brought the scope. We can check the vent chase.

                      NISHA
            If it’s a person, we call the cops. If it’s... something else—

                      KIRAN
            Then we stop feeding it your fear.

They pry open a VENT GRATE. Air hisses. A narrow, dark shaft.

                      KIRAN (CONT’D)
            Ready?

Nisha nods. He snakes the camera inside. On his phone: darkness—then a GLINT
of metal. A key ring. One key labeled “D.” Another labeled “R.”

                      NISHA
            R... for Rhea.

                      KIRAN
            Your sister?

                      NISHA
            She moved out months ago. Took her things. We haven’t spoken since.

A distant metallic LAUGH trickles through the shaft — or just warped fan noise.

                      KIRAN
            That’s not just air.

They kill the light; the phone screen shows a SMUDGE of a FACE for one frame—
then static. Nisha yanks the cable; the image freezes on a distorted grin.

                                                         CUT TO:


EXT. ROOFTOP – NIGHT

Wind. The city hums below. A humming VENT STACK rises center stage.

DEV bursts from the door, finds NISHA already there, gripping the recorder.

                      DEV
            You shouldn’t be up here.

                      NISHA
            Neither should you. Why is your key in the vents? Why is there one
            for Rhea? What did you two lock away?

The rooftop door creaks again. RHEA steps out, pale, guarded.

                      RHEA
            Because you asked us to.

Nisha falters.

                      RHEA (CONT’D)
            The doctor said externalize the episodes. Lock the triggers. You said
            you didn’t want to remember the D-ROOM. We hid the keys in the vents.

                      DEV
            We were trying to help you sleep.

Nisha’s recorder — the one from the alley — BLIPS red. A distorted whisper
leaks out: NISHA’S OWN VOICE, low and predatory.

                      RECORDER (NISHA’S VOICE)
            Don’t look back.

A beam of light sweeps across them. OFFICER MALIK and MR. VARMA emerge
from the stair door.

                      OFFICER MALIK
            Evening. We got a call. Neighbors heard banging. Everyone step away
            from the edge.

                      MR. VARMA
            I told you. Too much noise from 3B. Strange hours.

                      NISHA
            The vents are talking. The D-room is—

                      RHEA
            Nisha, breathe. Look at me.

Wind moans through the vent stack. Taps echo: Tap. Tap. Tap.

                      DEV
            It’s a broken damper. That’s all.

The recorder clicks off. Darkness thickens. Nisha edges toward the vent.

                      OFFICER MALIK
            Ma’am—

Nisha holds the recorder over the vent. Listens. A hush. Then a soft,
childlike version of her voice: “I’m still here.”

                      NISHA
            If you locked my fear away, why is it still inside the walls?

                      RHEA
            Because the walls are you. That’s what the doctor said.

A final COLD WIND surges, slamming the stair door shut. Everyone jumps.


INT. APARTMENT 3B – DAY

An overcast morning. Quiet. NISHA sits at the table. No fish tank glow.
The recorder rests between two keys: “D” and “R.”

RHEA pours tea. DEV stands by the window, tired.

                      RHEA
            We can bring the doctor back. Start again. No vents. No hiding.
            We keep the keys on the table.

                      DEV
            We change the locks again. New ones. No letters.

Nisha studies the recorder, presses PLAY. Silence. She exhales.

                      NISHA
            Tonight I’ll sleep with the lights off.

A soft, almost polite KNOCK comes from the ceiling.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The morning light thins as a cloud crosses the sun.

                                                     FADE OUT.
