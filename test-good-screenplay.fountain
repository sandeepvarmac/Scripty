FADE IN:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

A quiet residential street. Birds chirp in the distance. A young DELIVERY PERSON rides up on a bicycle.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH (30s, barista) works behind the counter. The bell jingles as MIKE (40s, regular customer) enters.

                    SARAH
          Morning, Mike! The usual?

                    MIKE
          You know it. Large coffee, black.

Sarah pours his coffee with practiced ease.

                    SARAH
          How's the screenplay coming along?

                    MIKE
                    (sighing)
          Still struggling with the second act.
          Sometimes I think I should just
          give up writing.

                    SARAH
          Don't say that. Every great writer
          has those moments.

She hands him the coffee.

                    MIKE
          Thanks, Sarah. You always know
          what to say.

EXT. PARK - LATER

Mike sits on a bench, laptop open, typing furiously. A smile crosses his face as inspiration strikes.

                    MIKE
                    (to himself)
          That's it! That's the missing piece.

He types rapidly, fully engaged in his creative flow.

FADE OUT.
