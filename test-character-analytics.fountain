FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH walks toward the entrance. A BARISTA is visible through the window.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Sarah enters. MIKE is behind the counter.

                    SARAH
          Good morning! I'll have a large coffee.

                    MIKE
          Coming right up. Beautiful day for writing.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. PARK - LATER

Sarah sits with her laptop. A JOGGER runs past.

                    SARAH
                    (to herself)
          This story is writing itself.

CLOSE-UP on her laptop screen showing the words "THE END".

FADE OUT.

THE END
