FADE IN:

EXT. PARK - DAY

A beautiful sunny day in the park. Children are playing on swings.

JOHN
(excited)
What a wonderful day!

MARY
I couldn't agree more. This is perfect weather for a picnic.

JOHN
Let's find a nice spot under that tree.

They walk towards a large oak tree.

EXT. UNDER THE TREE - CONTINUOUS

John and Mary spread out a blanket.

MARY
(looking around)
This place is so peaceful.

JOHN
Just what we needed after a long week.

FADE OUT.
