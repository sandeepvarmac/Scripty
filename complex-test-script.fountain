Title: Complex Test Script
Author: Test Writer

FADE IN:

INT. OFFICE - DAY

This is a very long action block that goes on and on and on with way too much detail about every single thing happening in the office including the color of the walls, the type of chairs, the brand of computers, and even the temperature of the coffee which is exactly 72 degrees Fahrenheit and has been sitting there for about thirty minutes getting cold while the protagonist thinks about their life choices.

PROTAGONIST
(very excited and talking way too much)
You know, as you probably already remember from our conversation last week when we discussed this exact same topic at length, I've been thinking about this project for months now and I really think we should move forward with the implementation phase because time is of the essence and we can't afford to wait any longer since our competitors are already ahead of us in the marketplace.

COLLEAGUE
Let me explain the entire history of our company to you even though you've worked here for five years.

PROTAGONIST
(continuing to ramble)
That reminds me of something that happened to me in college when I was studying business administration and took a class on project management where the professor, Dr. Smith - or was it Dr. Jones? - anyway, he told us about the importance of deadlines and how missing them can impact the entire timeline of a project.

FADE OUT.

INT. ANOTHER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Another overly detailed action sequence describing every minute detail of the room, the furniture, the lighting conditions, and the exact positioning of every object on every desk, shelf, and table in the entire office space which happens to be exactly 432 square feet according to the building specifications.

MINOR CHARACTER #1
I have one line.

MINOR CHARACTER #2
Me too.

MINOR CHARACTER #3
Same here.

MINOR CHARACTER #4
Yep.

MINOR CHARACTER #5
Just this.

PROTAGONIST
(still talking too much)
As you know, and I'm sure you remember from our previous discussions about this matter, we need to consider all the various factors that could potentially impact our decision-making process going forward.

FADE OUT.
