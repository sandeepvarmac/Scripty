This is just a plain text document.

It has no screenplay formatting whatsoever.

No scene headings like INT. or EXT.
No character names in ALL CAPS.
No proper dialogue formatting.

Just regular paragraphs of text that look like a book or essay.

This should definitely be blocked by the quality validation system because it has no screenplay elements that would allow meaningful AI analysis of cinematic structure, character development, or story pacing.
